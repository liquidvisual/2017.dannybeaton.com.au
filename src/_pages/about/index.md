We don’t always end up where we start and I didn’t start out as a writer. My talent was drawing. I illustrated comic book panels, heroes, monsters and new worlds. I kept drawing until my stories could no longer be contained in pictures, so I turned to writing and set out to be an author.

“Yeah, that could be fun,” I remember thinking. Such an idiot. Writing seems easy, you look at great authors and it looks simple, words on a page telling a story. But I wasn’t very good. I spent years writing a few manuscripts, short stories and even studying a Bachelor of Arts and majoring in writing. Writing was never easier, but eventually it was less hard.

Mal Winter and the Cloud Runners is the first book I published, and is an urban fantasy that is the product of effort, time and then some more effort and more time. The story was conceived to tell a fantastic story to an otherwise ordinary boy, and take readers on a wild adventure ride with its hero. It’s been out since the end of 2014, and now I’m completing the follow up, Mal Winter and the Last Titan.

I’m also working on another epic novel series, the first book is titled Seeds of Equilibrium and it is set in a dark, futuristic world following two young boys who are destined to change the very universe itself.

Beyond books, I’ve written screenplays, short stories and non-fiction articles. From that I won a flash fiction writing competition, had a script turned into a film (Blood Hunt) and had stories published in the Deakin Wordly magazine.
