The dreamscape seems a figment of Mal Winter’s imagination, but it’s real – and more dangerous than Mal could expect. The night after his father’s death, Mal dreams of meeting a mysterious man who introduces himself as Mr. Blue. The mysterious, yet kind, Mr Blue tells Mal that there is a Dreamscape that houses all the souls of the sleeping world. Each soul creates a dream to surround it like a large suit-of- armour to protect itself from Nightmares: the predators of the Dreamscape.

Nightmare aren’t bad dreams, they’re demons who prey on the souls of the sleeping, hunting through dreams to devour the sleeping. That’s when Mal learns about the Cloud Runners, an ancient organisation that protects the sleeping of the world and serves as the guardians of the Dreamscape.

Mal’s father was one of the greatest Cloud Runners to ever live, and perhaps his death wasn’t accident. Mal’s story takes him through dozens of magical dreams set atop mountains, foreign lands, impossible caves, tropical islands and endless skies to find out about the legacy his father left for him. Danger however isn’t contained to when he is asleep, Mal and his best friends Vic and James, are chased and tricked and the greatest adventure they’ll experience unfolds before them.
